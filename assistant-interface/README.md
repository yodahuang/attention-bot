## Google Assistant interface

### Install and get started

Follow the steps on [Google Assistant Service](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python/embed/install-sample) to configure the environment and generate credentials. Query Yanda for the confidential information.

Then run `python pushtotalk.py --project-id attention-bot --device-model-id attention-bot-pi` to see the demo.

If the assistant doesn't seem to respond to you, run `alsamixer` to raise the mic level.
